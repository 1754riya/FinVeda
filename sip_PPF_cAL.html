        <h3>What is SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)?</h3>
        <p>SIP, or Systematic Investment Plan, is a disciplined way of investing in mutual funds. It allows you to invest a fixed amount regularly, typically monthly, in a mutual fund scheme of your choice.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of SIP:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Disciplined Investing:</strong> SIP encourages regular and disciplined investing, helping you avoid the temptation of timing the market.</li>
            <li><strong>Rupee Cost Averaging:</strong> SIP allows you to buy more units when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high, resulting in better average costs over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Power of Compounding:</strong> The longer you stay invested, the greater the power of compounding. SIP enables you to benefit from the compounding effect over the long term.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Investment:</strong> SIP allows you to start with a small amount and increase your investment gradually as your financial situation improves.</li>
